## History of version

 Format : X.Y.Z

X : Major release, many new features

Y : Minor release, few features on a previous major release

Z : Fix for a minor release

- 1.0.0 : implementation of the BIP39 generator
- 1.1.0 : adding tests function

## Context
This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts: Generation of the mnemonic sentence and its conversion into a binary seed. This seed can later be used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP39 or similar methods.

Our library implements a [BIP39 generator](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) in C++. Fully workable on a python3 environment.

## Interaction with other components
```plantuml
@startuml
participant  "HMACSHA512" as hmac
participant "BIP39" as bip

hmac -> bip : call generate(int word_count)
bip --> bip : generate the mnemonic sentence
hmac -> bip : call get_entropy()
bip --> hmac : return the entropy 

@enduml
```

## Python functions
- ```get_langage()``` : Returns the language of the component.
- ```set_language(string language)``` : Sets the language of the component to French with parameter **"fr"** or to English with parameter **"en"**.
- ```generate(int word_count)``` : Generates the mnemonic sentence with **word_count** of words. **word_count** can only be chosen in the list [12, 15, 18, 21, 24].
- ```generate_given_entropy(string entropy)``` : Generate the mnemonic sentence given an entropy.
- ```retrieve_entropy(string mnemonic_sentence)```: Retrieve entropy given a mnemonic sentence.
- ```get_entropy()``` : Returns the entropy of the object bip39.

## Installation

Initialize dependencies:
```bash
cd project_blockchain_python
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Then compile:
```bash
cd bip39
make
```

## Usage

Open a python3 console and import the library:

```python
>>> import bip39 as bp
>>> gen = bp.Bip39("en") # By default "en"
>>> gen.generate(12)
'also lab path phrase inner magic metal expose involve roof hire spell'
>>>
```

You can change the langage in the constructor or with the function ```set_langage("fr")```

## Test
- Plan of test:
1. To check all the arguments are right
2. To check the length of entropy
3. To check the sentence of mnemonic with expected sentence

In order to check our component is working properly we have written a test code with the following methods.

```Generate()```: generate a mnemonic sentence. It needs to check the length of the string, then check the randomness by generating the mnemonic several times. Moreover, comparing all the results of test in order to make sure that they are random. We want the number of the words and it will retrun a result that we expect.

```Generate_given_entropy()```: generate mnemonic sentence given an entropy, entropy string of the entropy and retrun a string of the mnemonic sentence in the language that we selected. It needs to check if it returns a result that we expect.

```Retrieve_entropy()```: return a  mnemonic sentence. It needs to check if it is the particular entropy that we expect.

```Get_entropy()```: Convert the entropy in hexadecimal format and return the string of it. We take the mnemonic sentence as input and check weather the form is corresponding.

## Exceptions
You can only generate X words, with X in [12, 15, 18, 21, 24].
```python
>>> gen.generate(30)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: The number of words wanted must be in [12, 15, 18, 21, 24] interval
```
